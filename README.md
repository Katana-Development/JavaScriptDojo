# JavaScriptDojo
A VSC Theme for JavaScript Ninjas, 'JavaScript Dojo'. This theme was not built to be flashy, though it is beautiful; the purpose of JavaScript Dojo is to create a theme that has great readability, and syntax highlighting that is clear, consice and helps the developer locate needed syntactical stamentments, quickly, as it was designed to do. Many themes I have downloaded are very fun to look at, but upon using them for professional development I have to quickly switch back to classic material, ayu, darcula or solarized. Even the old school classics were not ideal as I once the felt they were when using other editors/IDEs to write code with, like JetBrains suite and Visual Studios IDE. This is not a remake of a theme that was made for an alternate IDE, with the color theme simply ported over via JSON/Theme-Tokens. This is a theme created in VSC for VSC by an avid VSC User and is developed specificly for Backend Node.js Development, front-end JavaScript Applications Development, &amp;/or Frontend web design using HTML5 &amp; CSS. Eventualy I will ad colorization specific to vue, but right now the color theme is specialized for JavaScript, HTML5 &amp; CSS.
